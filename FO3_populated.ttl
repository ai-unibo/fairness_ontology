Moreover, unlike the other definitions of fairness, this one does not necessarily re- duce racial disparities.

This can be met by selecting  the desired distribution p_q to be the distribution of the qualified candidates (items) over the protected attribute, while p_\\tau is the actual distribution. As for statistical parity, for  example, in the case of gender, it would require  that the top results always reflect the gender distribution over all  candidates, irrespective of the specific search or recommendation  task. Statistical parity can be met by selecting the desired distribution p_q to be the distribution of all candidates over the protected attribute. 2023_WANG classifies this as a \"calibration\" metric because it compares the actual distribution of the results with p_f desired distribution, which is function o the merit. However, this \"calibration\" term is not connected to the calbration-based metrics as intended by [2024_CATON] because it does not focus on PPVs. Furthermore, \"some measures of calibrated fairness and consistent fairness are interconvertible. Theoretically, for a calibrated fairness measurement, if we set pf to a uniform distribution, then it can become a measurement for consistent fairness. Similarly, for a consistent fairness measurement that contains f (v ), we can set f (v ) to p(v)/p_f(v) , then it become a calibrated fairness measurement.\" [2023_WANG]" .

(1) It cannot differentiate between bias of equal  extent, but in opposite directions. For example, given an equal desired proportion of males and females (i.e., p_{q,r,male} = p_{q,r,female} =  0.5), NDKL would be the same irrespective of whether males or  females are being under-represented in the top ranked results by  the same extent.

While predictive parity and calibration look like very similar criteria, test fair scores can fail to satisfy predictive parity at a given threshold. This is because the relationship between predictive parity and test fairness depends on the conditional distribution of R | A , which can differ across groups in ways that result in PPV imbalance. In the simple case where R itself is binary (Y^), a score that is test fair will also satisfy predictive parity." .
